# Twitter_Text

## Inspiration: Wanting to stay informed but also wanting to have a good day. 

## What it does
TwitFilter filters twitter feed, ranks tweets as positive or 1, neutral or 0,  or negative or -1. Twitfilter then breaks down where the negative tweets are coming from to allow users the option of bypassing negative tweets, thus having a good day.

## How I built it
TwitFilter was built using Flutter on the front end, Jupyter notebooks for the analysis and Firebase for the user authentication and database. Coded in Python using Django. 

## Challenges I ran into
Twitterscraper has been disabled due to abuse from current political events :( 
For demoing purposes we went with a static JSON file to use for data visualization. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Being at this event and presenting a prototype.
 
## What I learned
Although the twitterscraper was disabled, I did get to play around with Jupyter notebooks and run a few commands.
